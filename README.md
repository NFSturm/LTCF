# LTCF
The purpose of this repository is an analyis of a short story I wrote several years ago, when I was in high school. Its name was "Letters to Care For", hence the akronym of the repository. Below is the final output of the analyis, where the text was broken down in 59 sections with 143 tokens each. For each section, the sentiment score was calculated using the *AFINN*-lexicon. The analysis was conducted using the *Julia* programming language.
